## Key Observations

1. **This is ONE panel** - There are likely many more equipment lists for other panels
2. **Protection equipment focus** - This panel contains protection relays and control equipment
3. **Detailed specifications** - Includes manufacturer part numbers
4. **Small quantities** - This is not a bulk list, these are individual panel components

## Need to Find

To get a complete substation asset list, we need:
- Equipment lists for ALL panels (there are likely 10-20+ panels)
- Primary equipment lists (transformers, breakers, disconnectors, CTs, VTs)
- Cable schedules
- Vendor drawings for major equipment

Let me search for more equipment list documents.
